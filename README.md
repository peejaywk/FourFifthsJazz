### HTML Validation
To validate the HTML the online [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used. Each of the three pages was tested using this online tool.

#### Home Page ([W3C Validation Report](assets/documents/testing/HomePageNu-HtmlChecker.pdf))
On first testing the home page the validation tool came back with some warnings regarding possible misuse of the aria-label. 
On investigation the label was in the wrong element - it was in the *i* element used for the Font Awesome icon instead of the *a* element for the social media link. Moving the aria-label into the correct element removed the warning when the page was checked a second time.

The validation tool also highlighted an empty heading - this heading was removed from the code.

#### About Page ([W3C Validation Report](assets/documents/testing/AboutPageNu-HtmlChecker.pdf))
Contained the same warnings as seen when testing the home page - the footer code was common across all pages. Applied the same corrections as detailed above.

#### Contact Page ([W3C Validation Report](assets/documents/testing/ContactPageNu-HtmlChecker.pdf))
Reported an error with a bad value for the name attribute on the text area element. A blank name was causing this error. Corrected by giving the name attribute a value.

### CSS Validation

## Bugs

### iPhone Testing
Testing on the iPhone highlighted a problem with the background image on the home and about page. The background image was zoomed in and not scaled as on desktop devices.
Searching [Can I Use](https://www.caniuse.com/?search=background-attachment) identified an issue with iOS having an issue with the 'background-attachment: fixed' being used with 'background-size: cover'. Searching the Code Institute Slack forum also highlighted that other people have had problems with this in the past.
One solution [posted here](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp) was to disable parallax scrolling for all tablets and phones. As I couldn't find another solution for this that would enable me to have parallax scrolling on iOS devices I opted to implement this media query.
If another solution presents itself in the future then this will be implemented to keep the site consistent across all platforms.

### About Page
Navbar was scrolling instead of being fixed at the top of the screen. Added the missing 'fixed-top' to nav element - this fixed the problem.

### Contact Page
Navbar was scrolling instead of being fixed at the top of the screen. Added the missing 'fixed-top' to nav element - this fixed the problem.
